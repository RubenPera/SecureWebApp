# SecureWebApp

For this project the library kore.io is used. 
It is **strongly adviced** to follow the install tutorial on github of kore.io
https://github.com/jorisvink/kore

Because kore.io doesnt work well with projects pulled from git only the following folders are placed on github:
* src, for the c source files
* conf, for the configuration files
* view, for the html files

Because of this you should first create a project using kore.io and then import the github files into this project.

`kodev create SecureWebApp`
`cd SecureWebApp/`

You use checkout the files of this project into this folder.

Then use `kodev run ` to start the application.
