# SecureWebApp
2	
3	For this project the library kore.io is used. 
4	It is **strongly adviced** to follow the install tutorial on github of kore.io
5	https://github.com/jorisvink/kore
6	
7	Because kore.io doesnt work well with projects pulled from git only the following folders are placed on github:
8	* src, for the c source files
9	* conf, for the configuration files
10	* view, for the html files
11	
12	Because of this you should first create a project using kore.io and then import the github files into this project.
13	
14	`kodev create SecureWebApp`
15	`cd SecureWebApp/`
16	
17	You use checkout the files of this project into this folder.
18	
19	Then use `kodev run ` to start the application.
